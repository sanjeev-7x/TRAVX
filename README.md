# TRAVX


Welcome to my first HTML and CSS project! This is a simple webpage I created to practice basic front-end development skills. It includes a responsive layout with styled elements, demonstrating my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling.

## Project Overview

This project is focused on building a basic web page using just HTML and CSS. The goal was to learn how to:
- Create an HTML structure with headings, paragraphs, and images
- Style elements with CSS to make the page visually appealing
- Implement basic layout techniques, such as flexbox 



## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the page.
- **CSS**: Applied to style the elements and make the page visually attractive.
